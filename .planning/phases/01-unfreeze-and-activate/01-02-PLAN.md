<objective>
Tune activity probabilities so that the majority of ants are visibly active at any moment, and consolidate the Idle-to-Wandering transition to a single system.

Purpose: Even after wiring movement functions (Plan 01-01), ants spend 88-97% of ticks idle because the Idle-to-Wandering probability is only 3.9% per tick in movement.rs (and 11.7% in dig.rs). Additionally, the Wandering-to-Digging transition at 70.3% means ants that do start wandering immediately dig, leaving the surface empty. This plan tunes the probability system so ants feel alive.

Output: A simulation where >60% of worker ants are in active states (Wandering, Digging, Carrying, Returning, etc.) at any given tick, with smooth state transitions that do not oscillate.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Increase Idle-to-Wandering probability in movement.rs and reduce in dig.rs</name>
  <files>src/systems/movement.rs, src/systems/dig.rs</files>
  <action>
  The goal is to make ~30-40% of idle ants start wandering each tick, owned by ONE system. Currently two systems compete:
  - `movement.rs` line 35: `fastrand::u8(..) < 10` = 3.9% (10/256)
  - `dig.rs` line 167: `fastrand::u8(..) < 30` = 11.7% (30/256)

  **In `src/systems/movement.rs`:**

  1. In the `AntState::Idle` match arm, change the threshold from `10` to `90`:
     ```rust
     AntState::Idle => {
         if fastrand::u8(..) < 90 {
             random_movement()
         } else {
             (0, 0)
         }
     }
     ```
     This gives ~35% chance per tick (90/256 = 35.2%). An idle ant will start moving within 2-3 ticks on average, which feels responsive without being frantic.

  **In `src/systems/dig.rs`:**

  2. In `decide_worker_state()`, in the `AntState::Idle` arm (line 165-171), reduce the threshold from `30` to `5`:
     ```rust
     AntState::Idle => {
         if fastrand::u8(..) < 5 {
             AntState::Wandering
         } else {
             AntState::Idle
         }
     }
     ```
     This reduces dig_ai's Idle-to-Wandering to ~2% (5/256), effectively making movement.rs the primary owner of this transition. The dig_ai still has a very small chance so ants occasionally start wandering from the dig system's perspective, but it no longer competes meaningfully.

     Why not remove it entirely? The dig_ai_system runs its own state machine and returning `AntState::Idle` unchanged is the safe no-op. Keeping a tiny probability preserves the code path without competing with movement.rs.

  **In `src/systems/dig.rs`:**

  3. In `decide_worker_state()`, in the `AntState::Wandering` arm (line 130-137), reduce the Wandering-to-Digging threshold from `180` to `50`:
     ```rust
     AntState::Wandering => {
         if can_dig && on_ground && fastrand::u8(..) < 50 {
             AntState::Digging
         } else {
             AntState::Wandering
         }
     }
     ```
     This reduces Wandering-to-Digging from 70.3% (180/256) to ~19.5% (50/256). An ant will now wander for an average of ~5 ticks before starting to dig, giving it time to encounter food sources, follow pheromone trails, and generally be visible on the surface.

     Why 50? At 50/256 = 19.5%, the average wandering time is ~5 ticks. This is enough for the foraging system (which runs every tick) to check if the ant is standing on food, and for the movement system's foraging_movement to steer the ant toward food pheromone trails. At the old 180/256, wandering lasted barely 1 tick.

  **Summary of probability changes:**

  | Transition | Old Value | New Value | Old % | New % |
  |------------|-----------|-----------|-------|-------|
  | Idle->Wandering (movement.rs) | 10 | 90 | 3.9% | 35.2% |
  | Idle->Wandering (dig.rs) | 30 | 5 | 11.7% | 2.0% |
  | Wandering->Digging (dig.rs) | 180 | 50 | 70.3% | 19.5% |
  </action>
  <verify>
  1. `cargo build` succeeds with no errors.
  2. `cargo run` -- visually confirm:
     - Ants on the surface are visibly moving (wandering) rather than sitting still
     - Ants take several ticks of wandering before they start digging
     - The surface is not empty -- ants are visible above ground
     - No rapid flickering between states (Idle->Wandering->Idle->Wandering)
  3. Verify the exact threshold values with grep:
     - `grep -n "fastrand::u8(..) < 90" src/systems/movement.rs` -- Idle threshold in movement
     - `grep -n "fastrand::u8(..) < 5" src/systems/dig.rs` -- Idle threshold in dig
     - `grep -n "fastrand::u8(..) < 50" src/systems/dig.rs` -- Wandering-to-Digging threshold
  </verify>
  <done>
  Idle-to-Wandering probability is ~35% per tick (owned by movement.rs). Dig.rs Idle-to-Wandering reduced to ~2% (no longer competing). Wandering-to-Digging reduced from ~70% to ~20% so ants actually wander before digging. `cargo build` succeeds. Visually, the majority of ants are active at any given moment.

  <name>Task 2: Validate ant liveliness by running the simulation</name>
  <files>src/systems/movement.rs, src/systems/dig.rs</files>
  <action>
  After applying the probability changes, validate that the simulation feels alive:

  1. Run `cargo run` and observe the simulation for 10-15 seconds.
  2. Check that:
     - Surface ants are moving, not frozen
     - Ants transition between states smoothly (no rapid flickering)
     - Some ants dig, some wander, some carry food -- variety of behaviors visible
     - The simulation does not feel frantic (ants are not jittering)

  3. If the simulation feels too frantic (ants change state every frame), the Idle threshold (90) may be too high. Reduce toward 70. If ants are still too idle, increase toward 110.

  4. If the Wandering-to-Digging transition is still too aggressive (ants barely wander before digging), reduce the dig threshold from 50 toward 30. If ants never dig, it is too low -- increase toward 70.

  The exact values are empirical targets. The important thing is the FEEL: majority of ants visibly doing something, no freezing, no oscillation. Adjust if needed and document the final values.

  Note: This task is about tuning based on observation. If the values from Task 1 work well, this task is simply validation. If they need adjustment, make targeted changes to the threshold constants only.
  </action>
  <verify>

  2. `cargo build` still succeeds after any adjustments
  </verify>
  <done>
  The simulation feels alive. Majority of worker ants are active. Probability values are tuned and documented. Final values recorded in the summary. No oscillation or freeze bugs observed.
